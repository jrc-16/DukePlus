How to
=======

- Unzip it to C:\Users\jason\Documents\DukePlus


) Download the HRP ( high res pack ) from http://hrp.duke4.net/download.php

	- duke3d_hrp
	- duke3d_music-sc55


) Download the xxx pack from http://hrp.duke4.net/download.php


) Copy the duke3d.grp from Steam D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Duke Nukem 3D\gameroot\duke3d.grp and paste into C:\Users\jason\Documents\DukePlus ( overwriting any previous duke3d.grp ) 


) Copy the following zip files ( they need to be zipped! )

- duke3d_xxx

Then paste them into the DukePlus autoload folder.


) Click on eduke32.exe

- the EDuke32 dialog opens
	
	- Select Fullscreen
	- Polymer ( although i think you can not bother selecting here and select within the game pause screen )
	- Under "Custom game content directory" Select DukePlus folder
	- Select the "Enable autoload folder"
	- Selectt the "Always show this window at startup"
	- Click start

) You can confirm that you are running Duke Plus as "Duke plus" will be displayed on the main splash screen


@TODO
======
- Take a look at the EDuke32 Addon Compilation. Looks like it has loads of mods and Total Conversions.
